# CS601 Front-end Web Development Final Project
## Fall 2 semester, 2024
-----------------------------------------------
Purpose: Create a collection of web pages for the final project, showcasing what you've learned this semester.

Features: Non-react home page used, links to non-react static page in "proj 1", and also linked to React static page in "proj 2".

Linking "proj 2" was possible because it is either a non-build version of React app that uses CDN links, or the build folder of the React app, which is static.  React app in the build folder may need its links adjusted in order to work with non-react page links.  Linking back from React page to non-react page was not implemented yet.
